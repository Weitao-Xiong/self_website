# About me

I am **Weitao Xiong** 👋

🎓 I am a fourth year Undergraduate student at [Xiamen University (Malaysia)](https://en.xmu.edu.cn/). My Final Year Project advisor is [Prof. Hongfei Xue](https://havocfixer.github.io/).

I was happy to spend half a year in Hong Kong as a visiting student at [HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk/) (March - September 2025), advised by [Prof. Yuan Liu](https://liuyuan-pal.github.io/). Hong Kong is a beautiful place!
